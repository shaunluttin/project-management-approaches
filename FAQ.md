Q: How does this differ from throwaway prototype?

Q: Does this produce prototypes effectively?

Q: How does this differ as a strategy for a lifecycle instead of a build strategry?

Q: Does 'code-and-fix' result ever make in the hands of the customer? By contrast, 'throwaway prototype' does not seem to ever make it to the customer, while a result of 'code-and-fix' may. Is that right?

Rapid Development suggests that code-and-fix ought to land in the hands of the customer only as a throwaway prototype or a proof of concept. "Here is what we're thinking of building; does that look right to you? If so, we can get started today!" (edited) 

Think of it this way...

If you want to produce a throwaway prototype, then use the code-and-fix strategy to build it.

If you want to produce something with longevity, then do not use a code-and-fix strategy to build it.

Based on that:

> Does 'code-and-fix' result ever make in the hands of the customer?

Yes. :smile: As a throwaway prototype or proof-of-concept it makes sense to share it with the customer.

Yes. :cry: As a finished product, teams make the classic mistake of delivering with a code-and-fix approach.

> By contrast, 'throwaway prototype' does not seem to ever make it to the customer

It can have a positive role as a way to clarify requirements, discover ideal designs, et cetera.

It can have an unfortunate result if it lands with the customer as a finished product.

> while a result of 'code-and-fix' may.

Yes. :smile: And that works just fine when we frame the result as a prototype.

Yes. :cry: It tends to work out poorly, though, if we frame the result as a long-term, finished product. (edited)
