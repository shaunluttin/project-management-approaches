### Q: How does code-and-fix differ from throwaway prototype?

The code-and-fix is an approach to building something.

The throwaway prototype is something that we build.


### Q: Does code-and-fix produce prototypes effectively?

Yes.

### Q: How does this differ as a strategy for a lifecycle instead of a build strategry?

As a best practice, a developer might use code-and-fix to play with a technology, prototype something, clarify requirements, create a proof-of-concept.

As a classic mistake, a software team might use a code-and-fix approach to immediate start long-term work toward a vaguely defined goal.


### Q: Does 'code-and-fix' result ever make in the hands of the customer? By contrast, 'throwaway prototype' does not seem to ever make it to the customer, while a result of 'code-and-fix' may. Is that right?

Rapid Development suggests that code-and-fix ought to land in the hands of the customer only as a throwaway prototype or a proof of concept. "Here is what we're thinking of building; does that look right to you? If so, we can get started today!" (edited) 

Think of it this way...

If you want to produce a throwaway prototype, then use the code-and-fix strategy to build it.

If you want to produce something with longevity, then do not use a code-and-fix strategy to build it.

Based on that:

> Does 'code-and-fix' result ever make in the hands of the customer?

Yes. :smile: As a throwaway prototype or proof-of-concept it makes sense to share it with the customer.

Yes. :cry: As a finished product, teams make the classic mistake of delivering with a code-and-fix approach.

> By contrast, 'throwaway prototype' does not seem to ever make it to the customer

It can have a positive role as a way to clarify requirements, discover ideal designs, et cetera.

It can have an unfortunate result if it lands with the customer as a finished product.

> while a result of 'code-and-fix' may.

Yes. :smile: And that works just fine when we frame the result as a prototype.

Yes. :cry: It tends to work out poorly, though, if we frame the result as a long-term, finished product. (edited)
