# Pure Waterfall

### Introduction

- If you play chess with the Sicilian opening,
- midway through the opening you can play off book.
- In that case, you are no longer playing the Sicilian.
- Why does this matter? Semantics, right? 
- When you go off book, the gameplan changes significantly.
    - Risks
    - Traps
    - Advantages
    - Endgame Plans

Put another way, 
- If you start on a trip with a plan to walk,
- and midway through you decide to drive, 
- you can no longer usefully rely on guidance around walking.

### How does it work? 

- Orderly sequence of steps from concept to testing.
- Review at the end of each phase to determine whether to proceed or not.
- Document driven: documents carry work from one phase to another.
- Phases do not overlap.

# Advantages?

- Find errors early.
- Requirement stablility that (some) developers crave.
- Minimizes planning overhead; perform all planning upfront.
- Documentation provides meaningful progress visibility.

# Disadvantages?

- No tangible results until end of project.
- Lack of flexibility:
    - Very difficult to fully specify requirements at project outset.
    - No changes to requirements after passing requirements gathering!
    - Going backwards can happen but takes a ton of work.
    - Allowed to swim upstream. :-/
- Excessive documentation.

# When to use? 

- Stable product definition.
- Well-understood technical methodolgies.
- Well understood complex projects.
- Quality requirements dominate costs and schedule constraints.
- Technically weak staff.
